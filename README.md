Duration: October to November 2024
Mentor: Neela Santhosh Kumar

Goal:

Develop a simple to-do list application where users can:

1.Add, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. 2.Filter tasks by their state (All, Active, Completed).

Technologies Used:

1.React.js: Component-based architecture and state management. 2.JavaScript (ES6): Core functionality. 3.CSS: For styling and enhancing user experience. 4.Critical Functionalities: 5.Add Task: Users can add tasks using an input field and a button. 6.Task Completion: Toggle task completion using conditional CSS rendering. 7.Task Deletion: Remove tasks using a delete button. 8.Task Filtering: Use filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) to sort tasks based on their state.

Components: 1.TodoApp: Main component managing state and filters. 2.TodoItem: Displays individual tasks. 3.TodoInput: Handles new task submissions.

State Management: ->React's useState hook will manage the task list and filter state.

Event Handling: ->Event listeners for form submissions, button clicks, and task toggles ensure a responsive UI.

Learning Outcomes: 1.Understanding component-based architecture in React. 2.Managing state effectively with useState. 3.Handling events and conditional rendering. 4.Enhancing the UI with CSS styling.

Possible Extensions: 1.Edit Tasks: Allow users to edit task text. 2.Local Storage: Save tasks persistently across sessions. 3.Animations: Add animations for task actions. 4.API Integration: Connect the app with a backend or mock API.
